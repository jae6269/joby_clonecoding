            <h3>Redefining Possible</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              Today, our team of more than 1500 passionate engineers, experts, and leaders, are all focused on bringing our pioneering vision to life. We’re developing a world-class manufacturing facility in Marina, CA and have offices and workshops in Santa Cruz, San Carlos, Washington, D.C., and Munich, Germany.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>But it hasn’t always been like that.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="story3__story14__text"><p>
              Day and night, a small team of seven engineers worked out of “The Barn,” our workshop in the mountains above Santa<br> Cruz. We explored the frontiers of technologies like electric motors, flight software, and lithium-ion batteries — engineering<br> almost every component from the ground up.

              Joby became the first eVTOL company to receive airworthiness approval from the U.S Air Force in December 2020. Flying<br>our aircraft on-base and having access to government testing facilities provides an opportunity to develop our operational<br>capabilities in advance of commercial launch.

              We deepened our partnership with Uber, agreeing to integrate our aerial ridesharing service into the Uber app, and vice<br>versa, across all U.S. launch markets. Uber increased their investment in Joby and we acquired the Elevate division,<br>bringing their software tools and commercial launch expertise in house.

              In 2020, we signed our Stage 4 “G-1” certification basis with the FAA, having received an initial Stage 2 G-1 from the<br>agency in 2019. This document lays out a clear path to certifying our aircraft for commercial flights.

              During the year that Joby listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:JOBY), our pre-production prototype flew more<br>than 5,300 miles, including a flight of 154.6 miles on a single charge.
            </p>
            <br>
              <p>We also built a second pre-production prototype, completed our first FAA production conformity inspection and officially<br>began our journey to become the first certified eVTOL airline.</p>
